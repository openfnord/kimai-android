**EVIL: Unfortunately kimai went commercial: **

**I consider this to be Evil**

So I suggest to fork kimai and to continue open source development.

Therefore I researched using archive.org for the most up2date fork of kimai and found 
https://github.com/TiagoDanin-Forks/kimai-android
to be the last available version. 


forked from most up2date fork with commit https://github.com/gsantner/kimai-android/commit/680b8be95c766b87e27b5ac07d6975569c144971 (404)

https://web.archive.org/web/20221221162252/https://github.com/gsantner/kimai-android but not archived.


https://github.com/TiagoDanin-Forks/kimai-android/commit/680b8be95c766b87e27b5ac07d6975569c144971
is the same commit!


To verify press 68b8be on this archive and you are redirected to the same url ... 
https://web.archive.org/web/20221221162252/https://github.com/gsantner/kimai-android/


which is:

which not has been archived!




__In future, if you want to archive.org github projects make sure to click the "Download Zip" in Code to the top right to make sure, 
that archive.org archives the code base for future usage.__




So this is the best repo to my knowledge to fork the kimai time tracking app from, and I cloned this repo as I plan to fork kimai time tracker 
to lead it into the everlasting freedom of open source software.


Also the server application needs to be forked, as it could be removed by the original author without notice, as he could come to the idea to provide it only as a service collecting nice data on your projects and customers :-( 


So lets fork it.


Hopefully there will be active development soon.


**Quote of the last original readme:**


**Notice**: Project is not in active development, don't expect new features or fixes. The project is still maintained and is open for merge requests (contributions are welcome).

## Description
App for the time managment application Kimai.
This app makes mobile tracking and logging into your kimai existing installation easier.
You have to enter the URL, username, and password of your installation, if you want to be auto logged in after application start check the appropiate box.
To refresh page, long press on the green bottom button.

Additonally you can switch between 3 profiles. Each of them has his own dataset.

Normally you have to open your browser, go to favourites, click your kimai page, input data. Now you only have to do the last step every time you want to add entries.

This app was developed under non commercial purposes.
Actually there are no, and there will never be advertisments.

Any other data than your entered data won't be collected or stored on your device.
